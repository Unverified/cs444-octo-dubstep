<h1>Joos Complier For CS444</h1>  

This is our complier created for University of Waterloo's CS444 class. This compiler programs Joos which is a modified subset of the Java 1.3 spec targeting native x86 assembly. The compilers main languages was generated in racket however for the lexing stages we were not allowed to use Racket's excellent built in lexing utilities.
